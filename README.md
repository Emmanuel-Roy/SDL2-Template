# SDL2-Template
Basic Template for SDL to start Emulation Projects.


## Write Up
* I wrote this piece of code when I was first starting out writing emulators, namely before "EMOO-BOY" and also the CHIP-8 system as well.
* Therefore, some of this code is unoptimized compared to what I used for my final projects.
* However, I am uploading it here to share if anyone needs a basic reference for how SDL works, and for myself to use as an initial template when creating other emulated systems.
* The basics of this program is that it can create a window of easily defined length, allow for integer scaling to any resolution with that length, and randomize pixels on certain keypresses (WASD).
* I would include the more advanced features like multithreading the output, but I would honestly consult the EMOO-BOY and read the "DMGRenderThread" in "DMG.c" if you are so inclined.
